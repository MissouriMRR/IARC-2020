MIS_TAKEOFF_ALT: 0 > 80 (.5), 2.5, m
          Description: Take-off altitude
          Comment: This is the minimum altitude the system will take off to.

MPC_CRUISE_90: 1.0 > 20.0 (1), 3.0, m/s
          Description: Cruise speed when angle prev-current/current-next
            setpoint is 90 degrees. It should be lower than MPC_XY_CRUISE
          Comment: Applies only in AUTO modes (includes also RTL / hold / etc.)

MPC_XY_VEL_MAX: 0.0 > 20.0 (1), 12.0, m/s
          Description: Maximum horizontal velocity
          Comment: Maximum horizontal velocity in AUTO mode. If higher speeds
            are commanded in a mission they will be capped to this velocity.

MPC_XY_CRUISE: 3.0 > 20.0, 5.0, m/s
          Description: Maximum horizontal velocity in mission
          Comment: Normal horizontal velocity in AUTO modes
            (includes also RTL / hold / etc.) and endpoint for position stabilized mode (POSCTRL).

MC_AIRMODE: None, 0, None
          Description: Multicopter air-mode
          Comment: he air-mode enables the mixer to increase the total thrust
            of the multirotor in order to keep attitude and rate control even
            at low and high throttle. This function should be disabled during
            tuning as it will help the controller to diverge if the closed-loop
            is unstable (i.e. the vehicle is not tuned yet). Enabling air-mode
            for yaw requires the use of an arming switch.
          Values:
            0: Disabled
            1: Roll/Pitch
            2: Roll/Pitch/Yaw

MAV_0_MODE: None, 0, None
          Description: MAVLink Mode for instance 0
          Comment: The MAVLink Mode defines the set of streamed messages
            (for example the vehicle's attitude) and their sending rates.
          Values:
            0: Normal
            1: Custom
            2: Onboard
            3: OSD
            4: Magic
            5: Config
            7: Minimal
            8: External Vision
          Reboot required: True

MAV_0_RATE: 0 > ?, 1200, B/s
          Description: Maximum MAVLink sending rate for instance 0
          Comment: Configure the maximum sending rate for the MAVLink streams
            in Bytes/sec. If the configured streams exceed the maximum rate,
            the sending rate of each stream is automatically decreased. If this
            is set to 0, a value of /20 is used, which corresponds to half of
            the theoretical maximum bandwidth.
          Reboot required: True


NAV_DLL_ACT: None, 0, None
          Description: Set data link loss failsafe mode
          Comment:he data link loss failsafe will only be entered after a
            timeout, set by COM_DL_LOSS_T in seconds. Once the timeout occurs
            the selected action will be executed. Setting this parameter to 4
            will enable CASA Outback Challenge rules, which are only
            recommended to participants of that competition.
          Values:
            0: Disabled
            1: Hold mode
            2: Return mode
            3: Land mode
            4: Data Link Auto Recovery (CASA Outback Challenge rules)
            5: Terminate
            6: Lockdown

NAV_RCL_ACT: None, 2, None
          Description: Set RC loss failsafe mode
          Comment: The RC loss failsafe will only be entered after a timeout,
            set by COM_RC_LOSS_T in seconds. If RC input checks have been
            disabled by setting the COM_RC_IN_MODE param it will not be
            triggered. Setting this parameter to 4 will enable CASA Outback
            Challenge rules, which are only recommended to participants
            of that competition.
          Values:
            0: Disabled
            1: Hold mode
            2: Return mode

            5: Terminate
            6: Lockdown


COM_OBL_ACT: None, 0, None
          Description: Set offboard loss failsafe mode
          Comment: The offboard loss failsafe will only be entered after a
            timeout, set by COM_OF_LOSS_T in seconds.
          Values:
            0: Land mode
            1: Hold mode
            2: Return mode

COM_OBL_RC_ACT: None, 0, None
          Description: Set offboard loss failsafe mode when RC is available
          Comment: The offboard loss failsafe will only be entered after a
            timeout, set by COM_OF_LOSS_T in seconds.
          Values:
            0: Position mode
            1: Altitude mode
            2: Manual
            3: Return mode
            4: Land mode
            5: Hold mode

COM_RC_OVERRIDE: None, 0, None
          Description: Enable RC stick override of auto modes
          Comment:

COM_POSCTL_NAVL: None, 0, None
          Description: Position control navigation loss response
          Comment: This sets the flight mode that will be used if navigation
            accuracy is no longer adequate for position control. Navigation
            accuracy checks can be disabled using the CBRK_VELPOSERR parameter,
            but doing so will remove protection for all flight modes.
          Values:
            0: Assume use of remote control after fallback. Switch to Altitude
              mode if a height estimate is available, else switch to MANUAL.
            1: Assume no use of remote control after fallback. Switch to Land
              mode if a height estimate is available, else switch to TERMINATION.


LNDMC_ALT_MAX: -1 > 10000, -1.0, m
          Description: Maximum altitude for multicopters
          Comment: The system will obey this limit as a hard altitude limit.
            This setting will be consolidated with the GF_MAX_VER_DIST
            parameter. A negative value indicates no altitude limitation.

LNDMC_FFALL_THR: 0.1 > 10, 2.0, m/s^2
          Description: Multicopter specific force threshold
          Comment: Multicopter threshold on the specific force measured by
            accelerometers in m/s^2 for free-fall detection

LNDMC_FFALL_TTRI: 0.02 > 5, 0.3, s
          Description: Multicopter free-fall trigger time
          Comment: Seconds (decimal) that freefall conditions have to met
            before triggering a freefall. Minimal value is limited by
            LAND_DETECTOR_UPDATE_RATE=50Hz in landDetector.h

LNDMC_XY_VEL_MAX: None, 1.5, m/s
          Description: Multicopter max horizontal velocity
          Comment: Maximum horizontal velocity allowed in the
            landed state (m/s)

LNDMC_Z_VEL_MAX: None, 0.50, m/s
          Description: Multicopter max climb rate
          Comment: Maximum vertical velocity allowed in the landed state
            (m/s up and down)

LNDMC_LOW_T_THR: 0.1 > 0.9, 0.3, norm
          Description: Low throttle detection threshold
          Comment: Defines the commanded throttle value below which the
            land detector considers the vehicle to have "low thrust".
            This is one condition that is used to detect the ground
            contact state. The value is calculated as
            val = (MPC_THR_HOVER - MPC_THR_MIN) * LNDMC_LOW_T_THR + MPC_THR_MIN
            Increase this value if the system takes long time to detect landing.


GPS_DUMP_COMM: 0 > 1, 0, None
          Description: Dump GPS communication to a file
          Comment: Comment: If this is set to 1, all GPS communication data will
            be published via uORB, and written to the log file as gps_dump message.
          Values:
            0: Disable
            1: Enable
